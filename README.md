# Supplementary-AST-Based-Deobfuscation-Materials

This repository contains accompanying source code from the [ReverseJS](http://SteakEnthusiast.github.io) blog posts. I will continue update this repository whenever I write a new post.

# Usage

1. Install all dependencies: `npm install --save`


2. Then navigate to any folder of interest and run the deobfuscator against the demo obfuscated files: `node deobfuscator.js`

Happy reversing!
