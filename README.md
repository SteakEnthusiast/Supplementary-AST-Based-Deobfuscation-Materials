# Supplementary-AST-Based-Deobfuscation-Materials

This repository contains accompanying source code from the [ReverseJS](http://SteakEnthusiast.github.io) blog posts. These are short and sweet examples to help you better understand how to manipulate Abstract Syntax Trees to deobfuscate javascript. I will continue to update this repository whenever I write a new post.

# Usage

1. Install all dependencies: `npm install`

2. Then navigate to any folder of interest and run the deobfuscator against the demo obfuscated files: `node deobfuscator.js`

Happy reversing!

# Important Note

A lot of the code in this repository that _hasn't been published to the blog_ is outdated and experimental. Thus, they can be inaccurate and/or buggy. I do not recommend that you use them in a production deobfuscator. However, they are still useful for learning purposes. I have since come up with better ways to do things, but I likely will not be updating this repository with the new code.
