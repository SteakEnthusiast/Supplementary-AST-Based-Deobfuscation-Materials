# Supplementary-AST-Based-Deobfuscation-Materials

This repository contains accompanying source code from the [ReverseJS](http://SteakEnthusiast.github.io) (WIP, not yet live) blog posts. These are short and sweet examples to help you better understand how to manipulate Abstract Syntax Trees to deobfuscate javascript. I will continue to update this repository whenever I write a new post.

# Usage

1. Install all dependencies: `npm install`

2. Then navigate to any folder of interest and run the deobfuscator against the demo obfuscated files: `node deobfuscator.js`

Happy reversing!
